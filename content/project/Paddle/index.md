_Planning in a liquid world with tropical stakes_


__Grant__: European Union’s Horizon 2020 program

__Duration__: 3 years (2017-2020)

__Summary__: 
[PADDLE](https://www-iuem.univ-brest.fr/paddle) will bring together internationally renowned researchers and actors, from countries bordering the tropical Atlantic and from the EU, to create a network and a collaborative platform, which will build theory and methods for pertinent MSP in tropical areas. This interdisciplinary team will be a pillar of knowledge-based MSP by providing critical analyses of the tools and methods used, and by designing innovative approaches to efficient MSP.

The PADDLE proposal will create the first North-South interdisciplinary consortium on MSP in the tropics, highlighting opportunities and limits of tropical MSP and producing toolboxes for a broad range of stakeholders.
