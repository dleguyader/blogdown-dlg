abstract = "This paper presents a methodology for the spatial, temporal and quantitative characterization of maritime transport in the bay of Brest (Brittany, France). The high variability of transport flux makes, it is difficult to describe. Using AIS spatiotemporal database combined with GIS spatial analysis, daily sea traffic for maritime transportation of goods and passengers has been identified, quantified and mapped over the course of one year."
